I started eating rice so that I could finish my lunch. It was hard to get through a meal at my school's canteen when every adult in the vicinity probed my eating habits and wondered about my health. So I would reach for the stainless ladle, bump off the water from the pitcher it sat in, and dig out a modest scoop of rice from the five gallon, double-walled plastic bucket that retained it. The rice would occupy the corner of my plate, never more than necessary. While other teachers would cover their plates in rice, and add some vegetables on top, I kept mine to the side to ensure its visibility. I thought about these things.

I never liked rice though. In part, I’m sure, because I had somehow grown to believe it was unhealthy, despite my lack of any knowledge on the subject. But for other, perhaps less tangible reasons as well. Rice is boring. Which is not, in itself, a dealbreaker. Potatoes are boring and they are wonderful. But the boring foods I like are my comfort foods. My mother never made me a big pot of white rice for my birthday. My stepmom never served mashed rice to a full house. White rice is not a family memories sort of food. It is a peculiar intersect of foreign and boring. And why delve into the foreign if not to seek excitement?

The other night, though, a thought announced itself to me: *when I go home, I will continue to eat rice*. Unlike those pseudo-questions, there was no inflection in this thought. It was a truism, suddenly made visible. An eating epiphany.

Maybe I now like rice. I’m unsure. I certainly couldn’t tell you what I like about it. It’s not sweet. It’s not salty. It’s not buttery or rich. It’s just, rice.

Perhaps that is part of the appeal: it’s just rice. I come from a place where chefs are household names, where people shop at chacuteries and cook over Wolf ranges. Certainly, there is much to be celebrated about this level of interest in food, and I will not be giving it up anytime soon. But it can be trying to tell where passion ends and pretension begins. The intersection of taste and ethical consumption with exclusivity and marketing sits with the lees, murky at the bottom of the barrel. The fraternal pleasure of a shared meal is subtly tainted by the way such a meal is lorded over others. Eating feels like another way to maintain superiority and close doors. Plates and calories become boasts.

Standing across from the stars of those too-genteel menus is rice. As other teachers at my school are testament to, with enough outlets for the rice cookers, and enough propane burners for the pots to assist, this modest monocot can be made in quantities that seem infinitely scalable. And as I found the first time I hosted others with plates of nasi lemak, rice is cheap too. The ease of preparation, the price -- rice begs to be shared with others. It allows one to open their doors, and let in all who want partake.

I still betray my budding relationship with the humble grain before the haughty, though. After a trip a couple of months ago to Bario, Sarawak, I brought rice back with me to give to a few teachers – the highlands are known for producing the best in all of Malaysia. It cost about four times the price of the rice at the corner store. The day after receiving his gift, a teacher commented to me on how different the short-grained Bario rice had looked from what he normally purchases. And did it taste different, too? I begged. He seemed confused by the question. *Just like rice.*
